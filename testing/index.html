      <p>Amateur radio licensing is conducted by volunteer examiners (VEs) who volunteer their time administering the federally mandated tests in an effort to help the amateur service grow and improve.  The tests are given by a minimum of three qualified VEs who ensure all regulations are followed and standards are upheld.</p>
