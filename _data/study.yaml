  comments: Yes, this is a pay-for-play site. GASP! THE HORROR! Now that we have that out of the way, this site has a feature that none of the free sites have.  There is actaully learning material along with the questions.  You heard it right, this site tries to teach you the material rather than just memorizing hundreds of questions.  The price is not that different than the books and you get stat tracking and weighted questions.  I personally used this site to study for my Extra and aced the exam.
