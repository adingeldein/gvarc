We had a great turnout for the 2014 Field Day event!

A big thanks goes out to everyone that brought food and helped with the preparation!

In addition to the great food and company, the GVARC VE team tested 11 people resulting in 3 new Techs, 3 Generals, and 2 Extras.

Congrats to the new hams and the upgrades!  

The WB5LVI station made 67 CW, 36 digital, and 32 phone QSOs for a total of 476 points.  The general consensus is that GVARC will put more empahsis on operating the radios next year.  :)

Here are some memories of the festivites.
