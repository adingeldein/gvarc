### GVARC Annual Meeting – January 17, 2026  

The GVARC Annual Meeting** will be held on Saturday, January 17, 2026, in conjunction with the normal Saturday morning breakfast gathering at Granzins BBQ on San Antonio Street in New Braunfels. The meeting will begin at approximately 8:00 AM, briefly interrupting breakfast discussions, and will be conducted as efficiently as possible.  

In addition to routine club business, all dues-paying GVARC members will be eligible to vote in the election of the Vice President and Secretary at this meeting.  

Annual dues are payable in January and are $20 for an individual membership or $30 for a family membership. Dues may be paid by cash or check, and our treasurer, Mike Pfeuffer (WQ5C), will be happy to accept them.  

Thank you to all GVARC members for your continued support and participation, and best wishes for a great start to the new year.
