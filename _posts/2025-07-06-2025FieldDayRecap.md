GVARC’s 2025 ARRL Field Day was a huge success, showing major improvements over last year’s performance! 
Operating under the club call sign **K5C**, members racked up **580 QSOs**, a jump from last year’s 423. 
That boost was largely thanks to the persistence of KA0ZRW, N5ZR, and a dedicated group of robotics 
students who stayed late into the evening.

This year’s station class was **2E**, with 15 participants operating under generator and battery power, 
earning us a 2x power multiplier. Bonus points were awarded for 100% emergency power, youth participation, 
and web-based submission—totaling **290 bonus points**. Our preliminary score came in at an impressive **1,976**.

But beyond the numbers, the best part of Field Day was the camaraderie. As Dwight K5UH put it:

> “Having the group together where you see and hear everyone was the best.”

Special thanks go out to Mike WQ5C and his wife for hosting the event once again—your hospitality made 
it feel like a family gathering.
