Due to the VE testing session being held on January 4th, 2014 and the [SARC Radio Fiesta](http://w5sc.org) taking place on January 11th, 2014, it has been decided to reschedule our first business meeting of 2014 to Saturday January 18th 2014.

The meeting will be held at [Granzins BBQ](http://granzinsbbq.com) located at 66o West San Antonio Street, New Braunfels, Texas.  Everyone is welcome to attend, but you must be a GVARC member to participate in club business.

Stay tuned for additional details.
