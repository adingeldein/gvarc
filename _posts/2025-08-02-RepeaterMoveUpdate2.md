As of August 2, 2025, GVARC has completed a joint site visit with NBU staff to review the new repeater equipment location. Mike (WQ5C) reports that initial test showed that both UHF and VHF SWR readings at the site are acceptable.

The final piece blocking progress is the installation of a dedicated electrical outlet and ground wire for GVARC’s equipment. NBU staff had earlier indicated they "would take care of it," but the timeline and scope of that commitment are unclear at this time. This step is critical, as the team cannot move forward with installation until power is available.

Once power and ground are in place, and equipment racks installed, the move itself is expected to require three people with pickup trucks and will be scheduled for an afternoon. The goal is to complete the relocation quickly, with all work wrapped up well before the current tower is dismantled.

> “We’re ready to move as soon as NBU finishes the electrical work. Everything else is lined up—we just need the green light.”

Stay tuned for further updates and potential volunteer needs once a move date is confirmed.
