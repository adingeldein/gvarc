GVARC plans to assemble at Granzins on Saturday morning for the usual coffee and breakfast prior to the assault on the operation site.  Setup is scheduled to begin at 0900 local time and operations will begin promptly at 1300.

A pot luck dinner will be held on Saturday evening around 1800. Feel free to bring a dish, utensils, or a few dollars to drop in the hat to recoup food costs.  Unfortunately, there will be no homebrew available this year.  BYOB if you so desire.

A testing session for all license classes will conducted at the field day site around 1200 or 1300 or after setup has been complete.  All of our typical requirements apply and can be found [here](/testing/).  Please contact K5GST for further details.

This is a family event and all are welcome.
