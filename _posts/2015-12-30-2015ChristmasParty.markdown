On December 12th, 2015 GVARC held its 3rd annual Christmas party at Clear Springs Restaurant just
south of New Braunfels. The party was an awesome success and approximately 25 were in attendance.  

The party featured good old fashioned comradery, some of the best fried catfish and onion rings this
side of the Mississippi, door prizes, and a "50/50" draw where folks paid into the pot and the
winner split the proceeds with the club.

* First prize was a Jetstream 10W dual band mobile rig that went to N5LAS.
* Second prize was for a $25 gift card claimed by Thomas.
* Third prize was a donated Yaesu Fusion t-shirt that was awarded to W5TXR's daughter.
* Last but not least, the winner of the 50/50 draw was W5TXR.

To the chagrin of some, and the relief of others, no pictures of the event will be published since
what happens at Clear Springs, stays at Clear Springs.

We hope to see everyone and many others next year!
