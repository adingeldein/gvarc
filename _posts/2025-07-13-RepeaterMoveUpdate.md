The long-anticipated move of the GVARC repeater is now entering its final phase.

**As of July 12, 2025**, Mike (WQ5C) reports that the **climbing crew is officially scheduled** to begin antenna and feedline installation on **Wednesday, July 16**. The work is expected to take **two days**, though time has been blocked out through **Friday, July 18**, just in case.

Once this work is complete, the club will have until approximately **October** to finish preparing the new space and complete the equipment move from the current site.

This milestone follows other major achievements:

- The club secured a **formal lease agreement with NBU**: 20 years total (four renewable 5-year terms).
- NBU accepted the club’s **ARRL liability policy**, a favorable outcome over NBU's original requirement.
- All key hardware (antennas, Heliax feedline, duplexer, cabinet, rack, and jumpers) is already staged and ready for deployment.

Mike will provide further details at the **quarterly club meeting** this Saturday, July 19th.

> “We're in the home stretch. The climbers are booked, and once the antennas go up, the rest follows quickly.”

Stay tuned for the next update and any volunteer needs as the installation date approaches.
