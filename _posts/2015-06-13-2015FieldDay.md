GVARC plans to assemble at Granzins on Saturday morning for the usual coffee and breakfast prior to the assault on the operation site.  Setup is scheduled to begin at 0900 local time and operations will begin promptly at 1300.

This year we have a few other events scheduled for our guests.  At 1300 we are planning an arts and crafts event for the kiddos (by age or at heart) and will have a drawing specifically for the ladies in addition to ham related prize drawings.

Keeping with tradition, we will be serving light lunch and a pot luck dinner featuring smoked brisket which should be ready at 1700.  Please note that good food takes time and this time may vary.  Feel free to bring one of your favorite dishes or some rolls, chips, or dips.

A testing session for all license classes will conducted at the field day site at 1200 and another at 1600.  All of our typical requirements apply and can be found [here](/testing/).  Please contact K5GST for further details.

This is a family event and all are welcome and encouraged to participate.
