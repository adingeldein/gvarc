Our tireless VE liaison has reported another fruitful testing session.

K5GST reports that seven candidates tested, three upgraded their current licenses and one new candidate walked out with his Extra Class credentials!

Mr. Tangrady encouraged the three who didn't pass to try it again next time and reminds us that there are no failures unless one gives up.

The next testing session is currently scheduled for July 5th, 2014.  Contact K5GST for more details and check back here for the official announcement.

Congrats to the new hams and a big thanks to the testing team!
