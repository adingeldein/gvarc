On January 9th, 2016 San Antonio Radio Club will hold their annual Radio Fiesta in Schertz, Texas.  GVARC will have a table in the swap meet area where GVARC members will be able to sell their items in exchange for a small consignment fee.  The club is also planning to have a table inside where we will be accepting membership applications and discussing our repeater operations. 

The Radio Fiesta will be held at the Schertz Civic Center.  Please head over to the [ARRL site](http://www.arrl.org/hamfests/san-antonio-radio-club-fiesta-1) for full event details.

Hope to see you there!
