### History
##### The Early Days
            
Guadalupe Valley Amateur Radio Club established its roots in 1978 when the need for a local repeater in the 
New Braunfels area was realized.  The 147.000 repeater was installed and commissioned through the support 
of W5FFG (local legend and Godfather of Amateur repeaters) shortly after. Many Elmers assisted the young 
group over the years keeping the repeaters up and running.  Some of these elmers have gone SK and others 
are still providing support from the sidelines.

The call WB5LVI was first obtained in 1974 as a FCC Educational Club Station call for the New Braunfels 
High School Amateur Radio Club.  After Keith  Mitchell, WA5VTT, left his position with the school to 
work on his PhD, the club was sponsored by one more licensed science teacher before going inactive 
in approximately 1984. Many friendships were forged, untold quantities of coax was terminated, and countless 
contacts were made. At the time, GVARC functioned independently and was not affiliated with the call WB5LVI.
 Without a teacher sponsor, the high school club ceased to exist.  The station was dismantled, although 
evidence of its existence could be found (in the form of the club antenna tower) until the late 1990s, 
and the call was allowed to return to the pool.   

##### Present
Fast forward to 2005.  Through a need to support the operation of the 147.000
repeater, and as a result of tireless dedication from a few former club members, the
Guadalupe Valley Amateur Radio Club was reestablished and the WB5LVI call reclaimed.
WQ5C courageously led the club during the rebirth, continues to serve on the board,
and graciously allows the use of his shack for field day.  WB4DAD held the reigns for
several years, fearlessly leading the group while making a few CW contacts along the
way.  GVARC is currently {{ site.data.clubmembers }} members strong and growing every day.
If you have a license and are currently inactive, looking for an elmer to help you along, or need
 to take  your tests in order to join our ranks GVARC is here to help.

### Field Day
For four years and counting, the club has put on a event coinciding with the annual ARRL Field Day held 
on the fourth full weekend of June.  The club typically operates 2E (two transmitters running on 
emergency power) and also runs a GOTA (Get On The Air) station for inactive hams or non-licensed persons.
Although Field Day is a "contest" the club emphasizes fun and fellowship over competition. The highlights 
of the 24 hour event include exquisite victuals and award winning libations prepared by the club's resident 
pit and brew masters.  The GVARC Field Day is a family event and everyone is welcome, we usually have a 
representative of every age demographic.
